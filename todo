CALENDAR
https://fullcalendar.io/
https://themeteorchef.com/snippets/reactive-calendars-with-fullcalendar/

    https://fullcalendar.io/docs/list_view/
- custom validation that start and end date have to be on the same date
- be able to add multiple events (eg. every thursday)
- smart way to manage the calendar (note! if users have subscribed an event cannot be deleted!)

QUESTIONS
- refactor the Event.findOne in add_edit_event_modal
- publish all users to event for the participants list, is this safe?
- is the new signup page safe? password sent to server in clear?
- template error on user page, at least in firefox
- user unsubscribe from user page needs page refresh
- SECURITY: Roles.getUsersInRole('admin') from console gives me the admin user id. then i can just call the methods as admin
  -> in general are my server methods safe?
- batch update on mongo
- backup mongo
- make it nicer on mobile
- apply easy css
- do not require reload after update of signup (problems in list view)
